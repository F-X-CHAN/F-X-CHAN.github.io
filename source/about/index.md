## Info 
- Graduate student @ School of Physics, Peking Univ. 
- Supervised by [<font color='dodgerblue'>GEEEE Chen (陈基)</font>](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/chenji/zh_CN/index.htm)
- Email: hxchen (at) pku.edu.cn

## Education
- 2017.09 \- 2021.06, Bachelor, Physics, Peking University
- 2021.09 \- now, PhD student, Computational Condensed Matter Physics, Peking University

## Research Interest
Applying *neural network quantum Monte Carlo* (NNQMC, NNVMC, ML-VMC) to studying quantum phases in strong-correlated systems, such as:
- Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid @ *ab inito* hydrogen chain
- Correlated insulators @ Moire systems.

(Also, learning about many-body topological systems, and high temperature superconductors are cool.)

## Publications
TODO

## Talks
- 2024.10.26 "Probing quantum critical phase with neural network quantum Monte Carlo" @ Quantum Monte Carlo Youth Forum, Chongqing, China

## Misc.
- "Haoxiang" sounds like "how-shaang". "X" sounds more like "ch" in "sprichst" if you know Deutsch.
